# To do:
- clean up trash, unused elements etc.
- adjust alternative backpack panel
- adjust new item notification in alternative main menu
- check if there are darker vote, strange level up panels in the older version of Woolen's HUD
- fix missing elements in casual team composition at the beggining
- casual pre-game - background behind the timer
- check class loadout panels empty slots' corners
- check backpack and class loadout tooltip when hovering over stuff corners
- #base

# As an option:
- kills etc. instead of coin like in FlawHUD in casual menu for the alternative horizontal mode selection menu
- visible labels for item effect meters
- more themed, yahud like game timers

# Notes:
- alternative main menu backgrounds are not the same as Woolen's unfortunately

# Changes I don't want to make:
- stock, big gamemode orders (i.e. "Move your cart to destroy...")
- broken koth timers in tf_use_match_hud 1
- a bit clipped killstreak counter, "?" in backpack etc.
- clipped off pick up building icon in targetid
- stock ctf panel
- ugly, tooltips in main menu (only on some buttons)
- bulkier chat
- lower targetid when spectating
- probably a different mvm scoreboard
- a bit lower health position in alternative disguise status panel
- a bit clipped cap x in alternative payload panel
- a bit different positions in alternative payload panel
- a bit different width of the alternative payload panel
- bugged level label in main menu
- different transparency of the red team name in scoreboard
- clipped off endings of "y" etc. in alternative class loadout panels
- a bit different backpack panel in newest version
- no quality outlines on some weapon skins in backpack and class loadout panels
- different background of inspect panel when spectating and in-game (spectating darker, in-game b618c6037d50c8d218f430051af002659b276879)
- inconsistent smaller border on the bottom in alternative backpack & class loadout panels
- missing elements in casual team composition at the beggining
