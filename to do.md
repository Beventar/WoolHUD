# To do:
- clean up trash, unused elements etc.
- #base
- check if there are darker vote, strange level up panels in the older version of Woolen's HUD
- check class loadout panels empty slots' corners
- check backpack and class loadout itempopupoverborder corners
- check colors of labels of alternative item effect meters
- adjust alternative backpack panel (right)
- adjust new item notification in alternative main menu
- casual pre-game - background behind the timer

## As an option:
- stats like kills etc. instead of coin like in FlawHUD in casual menu for the alternative horizontal mode selection menu

# Notes:
- alternative main menu backgrounds are not the same as Woolen's unfortunately

# Changes I don't want to make:
- stock, big gamemode orders (i.e. "Move your cart to destroy...")
- broken koth timers in tf_use_match_hud 1
- a bit clipped killstreak counter, "?" in backpack etc.
- clipped off pick up building icon in targetid
- stock ctf panel
- ugly, tooltips in main menu (only on some buttons)
- bulkier chat
- lower targetid when spectating
- probably a different mvm scoreboard
- a bit lower health position in alternative disguise status panel
- a bit clipped cap x in alternative payload panel
- a bit different positions in alternative payload panel
- a bit different width of the alternative payload panel
- bugged level label in main menu
- different transparency of the red team name in scoreboard
- clipped off endings of "y" etc. in alternative class loadout panels
- a bit different backpack panel in newest version
- no quality outlines on some weapon skins in backpack and class loadout panels
- different background of inspect panel when spectating and in-game
- inconsistent smaller border on the bottom in alternative backpack & class loadout panels
