## Overview
This HUD is a replica of Woolen's HUD as seen from his videos on YouTube. By default the newest version of the HUD is used, elements from the older versions can be found in the "#alternatives" folder. Just remove the "_" inside the folder from things you want to activate.

#customizations are not faithful to Woolen's original HUD, past or current versions, but there are some useful customizations in case you want them.

My goal is to try to make an exact replica with as few bugs as possible. Some things are not faithful to the original HUD because they are either bugged or ugly.

**This is not intended to reach the public eye at this moment as Woolen himself doesn't want to publish his HUD and I respect his decision.**

## Some differences between this replica and the original HUD:

### Notes:
- alternative main menu backgrounds are not the same as Woolen's unfortunately
- alternative backpack panel (right) - the Y of my item slots are 121px, while Woolen's are 132px - because of the screen real estate taken by the latest updates and I don't want to shrink the slots
- Woolen probably doesn't use #base in his HUD

### Changes I don't want to make:
- stock, big gamemode orders (i.e. "Move your cart to destroy...")
- offset koth timers in tf_use_match_hud 1
- a bit clipped killstreak counter, "?" in backpack etc.
- clipped off pick up building/weapon icon in targetid
- stock ctf panel
- bulkier chat
- probably a different mvm scoreboard
- a bit lower health position in alternative disguise status panel
- a bit clipped cap x in alternative payload panel
- a bit different positions in alternative payload panel
- a bit different width of the alternative payload panel
- bugged level label in main menu
- different transparency of the red team name in scoreboard
- clipped off endings of "y" etc. in alternative class loadout panels
- a bit different backpack panel in newest version
- no quality outlines on some weapon skins in backpack and class loadout panels
- inconsistent smaller border on the bottom in alternative backpack & class loadout panels (right)
- darker engineer building not built background
