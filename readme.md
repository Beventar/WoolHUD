# Overview
This HUD is a replica of Woolen's HUD, as seen from his videos on YouTube, created using #base for elements from older versions and customizations. By default the newest version of the HUD is used, except for some ugly and annoying elements. Elements from the older versions can be found in the "#alternatives" folder. Just move the folders to the #enabled folder.

#customizations are not faithful to Woolen's original HUD, past or current versions, but there are some useful customizations in case you want them.

My goal is to try to make the best replica with as few bugs as possible. Some things are not faithful to the original HUD because they are either bugged or ugly.

**This is not intended to reach the public eye at this moment as Woolen himself doesn't want to publish his HUD and I respect his decision.**
