# WoolHUD

This HUD is a replica of Woolen's HUD as seen from his videos on Youtube. The main HUD folder contains the newest version, the elements from the older versions can be found in the "alternatives" folder.

This is not intended to reach the public eye at this moment as Woolen himself doesn't want to publish his HUD and I respect his decision.

## There are quite a few differences between this replica and Woolen's original HUD such as:

### Notes:
- alternative main menu backgrounds are not the same as Woolen's unfortunately
- alternative backpack panel (right) - the Y of my item slots are 121px, while Woolen's are 132px - because of the screen real estate taken by the latest updates and I don't want to shrink the slots

### Changes I don't want to make:
- stock, big gamemode orders (i.e. "Move your cart to destroy...")
- broken koth timers in tf_use_match_hud 1
- a bit clipped killstreak counter, "?" in backpack etc.
- clipped off pick up building icon in targetid
- stock ctf panel
- ugly, tooltips in main menu (only on some buttons)
- bulkier chat
- lower targetid when spectating
- probably a different mvm scoreboard
- a bit lower health position in alternative disguise status panel
- a bit clipped cap x in alternative payload panel
- a bit different positions in alternative payload panel
- a bit different width of the alternative payload panel
- bugged level label in main menu
- different transparency of the red team name in scoreboard
- clipped off endings of "y" etc. in alternative class loadout panels
- a bit different backpack panel in newest version
- no quality outlines on some weapon skins in backpack and class loadout panels
- different background of inspect panel when spectating and in-game
- inconsistent smaller border on the bottom in alternative backpack & class loadout panels
- casual pre-game - background behind the timer
- darker engineer building not build background
