- check backpack qualities rounded corners; backpack, class loadout panel background color (it's a bit colder I think?)
- clean up trash, unused elements etc.
- alternative payload panel - adjust payload race panel
- fix "NEW" quality in backpack not being shown
- darker voting, strange levelup etc. panels

as an option:
- big, different layout backpack screen
- improve casual mode selection panel (kills etc. instead of coin like in FlawHUD) for the alternative horizontal mode selection menu

I'm not sure:
- stock tournament panel

changes I don't want to make:
- stock, big gamemode orders (i.e. "Move your cart to destroy...")
- broken koth timers in tf_use_match_hud 1
- a bit clipped killstreak counter, "?" in backpack etc.
- clipped off pick up building icon in targetid
- stock ctf panel
- ugly, tooltips in main menu (only on some buttons)
- bulkier chat
- lower targetid when spectating
- probably a different mvm scoreboard
- a bit lower health position in alternative disguise status panel
- a bit clipped cap x in alternative payload panel
- a bit different positions in optional payload panel
- a bit different width of the alternative payload panel
- bugged level label in main menu
- different transparency of the red team name in scoreboard
- clipped off endings of "y" etc. in alternative class loadout panels
- different backpack panel in newest version
