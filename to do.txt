- triple check backpack darker blank slot; backpack darker, flat tooltips; backpack qualities rounded corners; backpack, class loadout panel background color (it's a bit colder I think?) etc.
- darker voting, strange levelup etc. panels (I don't know if I should do it)
- clean up trash, unused elements etc.
- adjust mvm scoreboard
- bulkier (with bgs) quickswitch menu, at the top of the screen
- clean up remaining deleted custom fonts stuff

as an option:
- big, different layout backpack screen
- more toonhud-like payload panel
- background behind ubercharge etc. labels in targetid and bigger ubercharge etc. labels
- improve casual mode selection panel (kills etc. instead of coin like in FlawHUD) for the horizontal mode selection menu
- maybe a bit broken older disguise panel

changes i don't want to make:
- stock, big gamemode orders (i.e. "Move your cart to destroy...")
- broken koth timers in tf_use_match_hud 1
- a bit clipped killstreak counter, "?" in backpack etc.
- clipped off pick up building icon in targetid
- stock ctf panel
- ugly, tooltips in main menu (only on some buttons)
- bulkier chat
- lower targetid when spectating
- probably a different mvm scoreboard
- maybe the stock tournament panel
