- smaller crit damage numbers
- backpack darker blank slot
- backpack darker, flat tooltips
- colder colors of the backgrounds in backpack, class loadout menus (hmm??)
- darker voting, strange levelup etc. panels (I don't know if I should do it)
- clean up trash, unused elements etc.
- adjust mvm scoreboard

as an option:
- class loadout stuff on the left side with character on the right with red and blu switches and more options to move character
- big, different layout backpack screen
- more toonhud-like payload panel
- older woolen's disguise status panel

	big changes not faithful to Woolen's original HUD:
		- "Find a game" horizontally retractable panel like in FlawHUD

changes i don't want to do:
- stock, big gamemode orders (i.e. "Move your cart to destroy...")
- broken koth timers in tf_use_match_hud 1
- a bit clipped killstreak counter
- clipped off pick up building icon in targetid
- stock ctf panel
- ugly, tooltips in main menu (only on some buttons)
- bulkier chat
